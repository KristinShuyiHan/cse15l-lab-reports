# CSE15L Lab Report 5

## Comparing different implmentation with different results of MarkdownParse

Two links being compared are [mine](https://github.com/KristinShuyiHan/markdown-parse) and [Joes](https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-w22/markdown-parse). To compare two implementations, I use thew following bash script provided by Joe.
```
for file in test-files/*.md;
do
  java MarkdownParse $file
done
```
This commands run `MarkdownParse`implementation through every single test in `test-files`directory. Then, to save the outputs for conparison, I use `the command bash script.sh > results.txt` to save Joe's Mkdp's ourput and `bash script.sh > result1.txt ` to save my Mkdp's output. Then, I type ```diff markdown-parse/result1.txt markdown-parseLab7/markdown-parse/results.txt``` command to compare the difference. The output shows difference in the way that listing my result at  a certain line number, then paced by a ---, and then the output of Commonmark. Then, I type `vim` to oepn the .txt files to locate the test by the given line number. Lastly, to quick search for the line number, I type in `:set number`.



## Difference 1: 487.md
My implementation had different answers than the implementation we provided for lab 9 at 487.md

According to [the output generated by the CommonMark demo site](https://spec.commonmark.org/dingus/),

the content of 487.md should generate 


```
`[a link`](url.com)

[another link](`google.com)`

[`cod[e`](google.com)

[`code]`](ucsd.edu)
```
output generated by the CommonMark demo site:

Becuase the backtick in front of the first link violates the link syntax, every link except the first is a valid link, so we should expect: **[`google.com, google.com, ucsd.edu]**

Turing the snippet into a test case, and saved as `Snippet1.md`
```
 @Test
    public void testSnippet1() throws IOException{
        Path fileName = Path.of("Snippet 1.md");
	    String contents = Files.readString(fileName);
        List<String> expected = List.of("`google.com", "google.com", "ucsd.edu");
        assertEquals(expected, MarkdownParse.getLinks(contents));
    }
```
My implementation of `MarkdownParse.java` fails the test, picking up every link as a valid link:
```
Time: 0.023
There were 3 failures:
1) testSnippet1(MarkdownParseTest)
java.lang.AssertionError: expected:<[`google.com, google.com, ucsd.edu]> but was:<[url.com, `google.com, google.com]>
        at org.junit.Assert.fail(Assert.java:89)
        at org.junit.Assert.failNotEquals(Assert.java:835)

        at org.junit.Assert.assertEquals(Assert.java:146)
        at MarkdownParseTest.testSnippet1(MarkdownParseTest.java:40)
```


Implementation of `MarkdwonParse.java` from other hroup also fails the test:
```
Time: 0.021
There were 3 failures:
1) testSnippet1(MarkdownParseTest)
java.lang.AssertionError: expected:<[`google.com, google.com, ucsd.edu]> but was:<[url.com, `google.com, google.com, ucsd.edu]>
        at org.junit.Assert.fail(Assert.java:89)
        at org.junit.Assert.failNotEquals(Assert.java:835)
        at org.junit.Assert.assertEquals(Assert.java:120)
        at org.junit.Assert.assertEquals(Assert.java:146)
        at MarkdownParseTest.testSnippet1(MarkdownParseTest.java:18)
```



Yes. We just need to make sure the backticks have to come in pairs inside the outtermost bracket. To do so, I can set a variable as the value of number of backticks among the content inside the outtermost bracket by setting a forloop to compare each character in the outtermost bracket with ```, if it is equal, increments the value. 


## Difference 2: 342.md
