# CSE15L Lab Report 5

## Comparing different implmentation with different results of MarkdownParse

Two links being compared are [mine](https://github.com/KristinShuyiHan/markdown-parse) and [Joes](https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-w22/markdown-parse). To compare two implementations, I use thew following bash script provided by Joe.
```
for file in test-files/*.md;
do
  java MarkdownParse $file
done
```
This commands run `MarkdownParse`implementation through every single test in `test-files`directory. Then, to save the outputs for conparison, I use `the command bash script.sh > results.txt` to save Joe's Mkdp's ourput and `bash script.sh > result1.txt ` to save my Mkdp's output. Then, I type ```diff markdown-parse/result1.txt markdown-parseLab7/markdown-parse/results.txt``` command to compare the difference. The output shows difference in the way that listing my result at  a certain line number, then paced by a ---, and then the output of Commonmark. Then, I type `vim` to oepn the .txt files to locate the test by the given line number. Lastly, to quick search for the line number, I type in `:set number`.



## Difference 1: 487.md
My implementation had different answers than the implementation we provided for lab 9 at 487.md

According to [the output generated by the CommonMark demo site](https://spec.commonmark.org/dingus/),

the whole testfile as it neither creats a valid link name, nor valid link, so the correct output given by Markdownparse should be empty `[]`
However
```
Joe's Output
< [] test-files/487.md
---
My Output
> [/my uri]  test-files/487.md 
```


## Difference 2: 342.md

My implementation had different answers than the implementation we provided for lab 9 at 342.md at line 542

According to [the output generated by the CommonMark demo site](https://spec.commonmark.org/dingus/),

Although the test file generates an valid link name, since other than the file name, there is nothing bheind it in the file, so the implementation of MarkdownParse is supposed to generate `[]` as correct output, indicating there is no valid link.
However
```
Joe's Output
< []   test-files/342.md 
---
My Output
> [/foo`] test-files/342.md
```
